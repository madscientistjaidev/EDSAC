# EDSAC
A simulator and shell for the EDSAC computer.

This project is a work in progress. Several features mentioned in the documentation are yet to be implemented, and the code contains many undocumented features.

The operation of the simulator is reasonably similar to the actual computer, but incomplete documentation means that it is not an entirely faithful reimplementation.
